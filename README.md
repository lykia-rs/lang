Lykia is a toy document database basically written for educational purposes. It is planned to be a modest mixture of popular kids in town (e.g. SurrealDB).

## Overview
- Written in Rust
- A weird scripting and query language, combination of JavaScript and SQL. Built based on the language "Lox" which is explained in the famous book, Crafting Interpreters.
- A subset of JSON data types in both scripting language itself and storage
- In-disk and in-memory storage
- ACID compliance
- Replication

## Roadmap

- [x] Core scripting language
- [x] A minimal standard library
- [ ] SQL parsing
    - [x] "SELECT" expressions (the most complex part of the SQL syntax)
    - [ ] "INSERT" statements (in progress)
    - [ ] "UPDATE" statements (in progress)
    - [ ] "DELETE" statements (in progress)
- [ ] Query planning (in progress)
- [ ] Plan optimization
- [ ] Async runtime/event loop
- [ ] In-memory storage engine
- [ ] Type checker
- [ ] Persistent storage engine (Bitcask)
- [ ] Transaction management with MVCC
- [ ] B-Tree implementation for indexes
- [ ] Basic replication with Raft
