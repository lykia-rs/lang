Lykia is a toy multi-model database basically written for educational purposes.

## Overview
- Written in Rust
- A weird scripting and query language, combination of JavaScript and SQL. Built based on the language "Lox" which is explained in the famous book, Crafting Interpreters.
- A subset of JSON data types in both scripting language itself and storage
- In-disk and in-memory storage
- ACID compliance
- Replication

## Roadmap

- [x] Core scripting language
- [x] A minimal standard library
- [x] Data manipulation language ("SELECT", "INSERT", "UPDATE", "DELETE")
- [x] Event loop, client-server communication
- [x] Minimal playground app
- [ ] Data definition language ("CREATE COLLECTION", etc.) (in progress)
- [ ] Query binding and planning (in progress)
- [ ] LSM storage engine (based on [mini-lsm](https://github.com/lykia-rs/mini-lsm)) (in progress)
- [ ] MVCC for transaction management (based on [mini-lsm](https://github.com/lykia-rs/mini-lsm))
- [ ] B-Tree implementation for indexing
- [ ] Plan optimization
- [ ] Basic replication with Raft
